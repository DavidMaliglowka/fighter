# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Physics-Based Jumping and Gravity System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace free up/down movement with platformer-style jumping mechanics including single jump, double jump, and constant gravity
# Details:
Enable Phaser 3 Arcade Physics in client (public/index.html): scene.physics.world.gravity.y = 800. Add jump input handling for spacebar/up arrow with velocity.y = -500 for single jump, -400 for double jump. Track jump state (grounded, single, double) in player object. Server-side validation in server.js: check if player is grounded before allowing jumps, sync positions via Socket.IO at 60fps. Use Phaser's body.touching.down for ground detection. Implement client-side prediction for smooth jumping feel while server maintains authority.

# Test Strategy:
Test with 2-4 browser tabs: verify smooth jumping animation, double jump works only after single jump, gravity pulls players down consistently across all clients. Use Socket.IO debug logs to verify jump state synchronization.

<info added on 2025-07-16T05:46:05.079Z>
Completed Jump Input Handling and State Management:

✅ **Client-Side Input Changes**:
- Modified input system to use `up arrow` for jump instead of movement
- Used `JustDown` for jump input to prevent spam jumping
- Updated controls display to show "Up: Jump"

✅ **Server-Side Jump State Tracking**:
- Added `isGrounded`, `jumpsRemaining`, `lastJumpTime` to player objects
- Added `velocityX`, `velocityY` for physics tracking
- Set `jumpsRemaining: 2` for double jump capability

✅ **Jump Velocity Logic**:
- First jump: `velocityY = -500` (stronger)
- Double jump: `velocityY = -400` (weaker)
- Jump cooldown: 200ms between jumps
- Proper jump state management

✅ **Physics Integration**:

Fixed Critical Physics and Rendering Issues:

**Position Update Bug Resolution**:
- Resolved `playerSprites[id].body.setPosition is not a function` error by switching to `playerSprites[id].setPosition(player.x, player.y)`
- Error occurred because client sprites no longer have physics bodies

**Client-Server Physics Separation**:
- Eliminated client-side physics bodies completely to prevent server-client conflicts
- Client now handles only visual rendering with simple sprites
- Server maintains full physics authority for all calculations including gravity, jumping, and collisions

**Architecture Cleanup**:
- Established clear separation: Client = visual display only, Server = all physics logic
- Removed physics debug mode since client no longer has physics bodies
- Streamlined rendering pipeline for better performance

**Multiplayer Behavior Clarification**:
- Page reload behavior (new players on refresh) is standard Socket.IO functionality
- Each browser refresh creates new socket connection and player instance
- Persistent player identity would require authentication system (planned for Task 9)

System now operates with clean server-authoritative physics and conflict-free client rendering. Jump mechanics function correctly with server calculating all physics and clients receiving position updates for smooth visual display.

<info added on 2025-07-16T05:55:22.572Z>
Ground Detection and Collision Logic - Completed via Server-Side Implementation:

✅ **Server-Authoritative Ground Detection**:
- Implemented in `updatePhysics()` function using `GROUND_Y = 560` constant
- Ground collision check: `if (player.y >= GROUND_Y)` for reliable detection
- Position correction: `player.y = GROUND_Y` when touching ground
- Velocity reset: `player.velocityY = 0` on ground contact

✅ **Jump State Management on Landing**:
- Automatic `isGrounded = true` when player touches ground
- Jump counter reset: `jumpsRemaining = 2` for fresh double jump capability
- Air state detection: `isGrounded = false` when above ground level

✅ **Architecture Decision - Server vs Client Physics**:
- **Original Plan**: Use Phaser's `body.touching.down` for client-side detection
- **Implemented Solution**: Server-authoritative ground detection for consistency
- **Benefits**: Eliminates client-server physics conflicts, prevents cheating, ensures sync

✅ **Collision Logic Features**:
- Reliable ground collision at consistent Y position across all players
- Instant state transitions between air/ground states
- Edge case handling for precise collision detection
- No bounce or settling physics for clean platformer feel

The ground detection system is working perfectly with server authority, providing consistent physics across all clients and accurate jump state management.

**Final Optimization: Input Consistency & Health Bar Prediction**

**Input Cancellation Consistency**: 
- Added same left+right input cancellation logic to client prediction as server has
- Client now processes: `if (inputs.left && inputs.right) { inputs.left = false; inputs.right = false; }`
- Eliminates prediction errors caused by client/server input processing mismatches
- Added debug panel indicator showing "CANCELLED (L+R)" in red vs "Normal" in green

**Health Bar Prediction Enhancement**:
- Health bars now use predicted position for local player: `clientPlayerState.x/y` vs server position for others
- Eliminates visual lag where health bar trails behind player sprite during local movement
- Both player sprite and health bar now update immediately on local input

**Design Philosophy Confirmed**:
- Client prediction should mirror server logic exactly for consistency
- This isn't about client security (impossible) but about minimizing prediction corrections
- Perfect input processing alignment reduces jitter and visual artifacts

**Performance Impact**:
- Input cancellation adds minimal CPU overhead (~1-2 operations per frame)
- Debug panel provides real-time feedback on input processing status
- Health bar prediction eliminates visual disconnects during local player movement

**Technical Result**: Client prediction now perfectly matches server input validation while maintaining responsive local movement with synchronized visual elements.
