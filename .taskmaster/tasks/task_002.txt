# Task ID: 2
# Title: Add Dash Mechanics with Cooldown System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement quick burst movement (dashing) triggered by double-tap or dedicated key with cooldown to prevent spam
# Details:
Add dash input detection in client: track double-tap timing for left/right arrows or use dedicated key (shift). Apply horizontal velocity boost (velocity.x += direction * 300) with 0.5s cooldown. Server-side: validate dash availability, apply knockback-style movement, broadcast position updates. Store dash cooldown timestamp in player object. Client-side prediction: immediately show dash movement, server corrects if invalid. Add visual feedback with brief trail effect using Phaser particles.

# Test Strategy:
Verify dash works in all directions, cooldown prevents spam, smooth movement across multiple clients. Test edge cases like dashing into walls or off platforms.

# Subtasks:
