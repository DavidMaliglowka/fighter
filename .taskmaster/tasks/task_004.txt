# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Combo System with Attack Chaining
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add ability to chain attacks together with timing-based combos and stun effects
# Details:
Extend handleCombat() in server.js: track attack sequences with timestamps, detect combos based on timing windows (500ms between attacks). Add combo counter and damage multiplier (1.2x for 2-hit, 1.5x for 3-hit). Implement stun states: brief movement disable (200ms) after being hit to enable follow-ups. Client-side: show combo counter UI, attack animation sequences. Add knock-up effect for aerial combos using velocity.y = -200. Store combo state in player object with resetTimer.

# Test Strategy:
Test combo chains work with proper timing, damage multipliers apply correctly, stun prevents movement briefly. Verify combo resets after timeout or successful completion across multiple clients.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Attack Sequence Tracking and Timing Windows [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement attack sequence tracking with timestamp-based timing windows to detect valid combo chains
### Details:
Extend handleCombat() in server.js to track attack sequences with timestamps. Store attack history in player object with array of {timestamp, attackType} entries. Implement timing window validation (500ms between attacks) to determine valid combo chains. Add sequence reset logic when timing window expires or player is hit. Track combo state with resetTimer and cleanup expired sequences.

## 2. Combo Detection Logic and Damage Multipliers [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Implement combo detection algorithms and progressive damage multiplier system
### Details:
Add combo detection logic that analyzes attack sequences to identify valid combos. Implement damage multiplier system: 1.2x for 2-hit combos, 1.5x for 3-hit combos, scaling further for longer chains. Calculate final damage by applying multipliers to base attack damage. Store combo counter in player object and increment on successful chained attacks. Add combo validation to ensure attacks connect within timing windows.

## 3. Stun State Implementation and Movement Restrictions [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement stun mechanics with movement restrictions and recovery states
### Details:
Add stun state to player object with duration tracking (200ms base stun). Implement movement restriction logic that disables player input during stun period. Add stun recovery system with gradual movement restoration. Implement knock-up effect for aerial combos using velocity.y = -200. Add stun resistance scaling to prevent infinite combos. Sync stun states across clients via Socket.IO.

## 4. Client-Side UI and Animation Sequences [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Create visual feedback systems including combo counter UI and attack animation sequences
### Details:
Implement combo counter UI display that shows current combo count and multiplier. Add attack animation sequences that chain smoothly for combo attacks. Create visual effects for successful combos including screen shake and particle effects. Implement damage number display with multiplier indicators. Add combo break notifications and reset animations. Use Phaser's animation system for smooth transitions between attack states.

## 5. Server-Side Validation and State Synchronization [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Implement authoritative server validation and real-time state synchronization for combo system
### Details:
Add server-side validation for all combo actions to prevent cheating. Implement authoritative combo state management with client reconciliation. Add real-time synchronization of combo states, damage calculations, and stun effects across all clients. Implement lag compensation for combo timing validation. Add network optimization for frequent combo state updates. Ensure consistent game state across all connected players with proper error handling and rollback mechanisms.
