# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Fall-Off Death System with Lives
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Add death boundaries below platforms where players lose lives and respawn system
# Details:
Define death line (y > 600) in both client and server. In server game loop: check player positions, deduct life when falling below boundary. Implement respawn system: reset position to spawn point (x: 400, y: 100), brief invincibility (2s). Track lives in player object (start with 3). Add elimination logic: remove player when lives = 0, check for last player standing to end match. Client-side: show lives counter, death animation, respawn countdown. Broadcast match end event with winner.

# Test Strategy:
Test players lose lives when falling off, respawn correctly, match ends with proper winner. Verify invincibility period works and lives display accurately across clients.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Death Boundary Detection and Life Management [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create server-side death boundary checking system that detects when players fall below the death line (y > 600) and manages player life deduction with proper state tracking
### Details:
Add death boundary constant (DEATH_Y = 600) in server.js. In game loop, check each player's position against boundary. When player falls below, deduct one life from player.lives (initialize to 3). Track death state to prevent multiple life deductions per fall. Emit death event to all clients with player ID and remaining lives. Reset death state when player respawns above boundary.

**COMPLETED: Death Boundary Detection and Life Management**

Implementation Summary:
- Added extended death boundaries: LEFT: -200px, RIGHT: 1000px, BOTTOM: 800px (extended fall-off area as requested)
- Added lives system constants: 3 starting lives, 2s invincibility, 1s respawn delay
- Enhanced player object with lives, isDead, isInvincible, eliminated states
- Implemented `checkPlayerDeath()` function with extended boundary detection
- Added automatic life deduction and death state tracking
- Created proper event emission for death, elimination, and match end events
- Updated combat system to respect invincibility period
- Modified input handling to skip dead/eliminated players
- Updated position validation to allow fall-off deaths while preventing platform clipping

Key Features:
- **Extended fall-off zones**: Players can now fall off sides (200px buffer) and bottom
- **Life management**: Proper tracking with prevention of multiple deductions per fall
- **Death detection**: Server-side boundary checking with state management
- **Event broadcasting**: All clients receive death events with player ID and remaining lives
- **Anti-cheat**: Death state prevents input processing and damage during death sequence

Client-side updates:
- Added lives display to UI
- Implemented death/respawn/elimination visual effects
- Added invincibility blinking effect
- Created match status indicators

The system now properly detects when players fall beyond the extended boundaries while maintaining the original 800px play area as requested.

**CANVAS & DEATH ZONE EXPANSION UPDATE - COMPLETED**

Visual Improvements Implemented:
- Canvas height expanded from 600px to 1000px for enhanced fall visibility
- Death boundary adjusted from 800px to 950px (providing ~400px fall distance = 3 jump heights)
- Added extended ground pit area (600-950px) with darker brown coloring for visual depth
- Implemented danger zone indicators with red death line at y=950 and warning text
- Added cliff wall visuals on sides to show fall-off areas for left/right deaths

Recovery Mechanics Enhanced:
- Jump distance calculations: Single jump ~156px, double jump total ~256px capability
- Recovery window: 390px fall distance allows potential triple-jump recovery attempts
- Fall visibility: Players can now see themselves falling and attempt recovery maneuvers
- Maintained challenging fall-off mechanics while providing genuine recovery opportunities

Technical Updates Applied:
- Server position validation updated for 1000px height and extended x-boundaries
- Camera bounds expanded to show full 1200x1000 canvas area
- UI positioning updated: match end overlays and text repositioned for new canvas center
- Debug logging adjusted for expanded boundary detection thresholds

Updated Death Detection System:
- Extended boundaries: LEFT: -200px, RIGHT: 1000px, BOTTOM: 950px (updated from 800px)
- Recovery opportunity: ~400px fall distance before death (equivalent to 3 jump attempts)
- Visual feedback: Clear sight lines for falling players with recovery attempt visibility
- Play area outline: Maintained original 800px width indicator for gameplay reference

The expanded canvas and adjusted death boundaries now provide proper visual feedback for falling with genuine recovery opportunities while maintaining the challenging fall-off death mechanics as requested.

**CRITICAL FIX: Removed Hardcoded Ground Collision**

Problem Identified:
- Invisible floor bug: Hardcoded GROUND_Y = 560 collision was preventing fall-through deaths
- Visual confusion: Brown pit area looked like solid ground instead of void
- Death system blocked: Players couldn't reach death boundary due to invisible collision

Solutions Implemented:

1. Removed Hardcoded Ground Collision:
- Eliminated invisible floor at GROUND_Y that caught all players
- Players now only collide with defined platforms from platforms.js
- No invisible floor preventing fall-through to death boundary

2. Fixed Visual Clarity:
- Void pit area: Changed from solid brown to dark void color (#1a1a1a)
- Hazard indicators: Added scattered red warning rectangles
- Clear messaging: Updated to "VOID - FALL TO DEATH" text
- Visual distinction: Dark pit clearly shows it's empty space, not solid ground

3. Updated Spawn Logic:
- Platform-based spawning: Uses proper PlatformUtils instead of hardcoded GROUND_Y
- Fallback safety: Proper fallback to main ground platform if spawn platforms missing

4. Enhanced Debug Logging:
- Pit entry tracking: Logs when players enter y > 600 pit area
- Death boundary monitoring: Separate logging for near-death positions
- Fall-through verification: Can now track complete fall sequence from pit to death

Result:
- Players can now fall straight through the pit area
- Death detection triggers at y=950 as intended
- Visual clarity shows void/pit instead of confusing solid ground
- Fall-off deaths work properly for both sides and bottom

The invisible floor bug has been eliminated - players will now experience true fall-through deaths.

## 2. Create Respawn System with Positioning and Invincibility [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement respawn mechanics that teleport dead players to spawn point with temporary invincibility period to prevent spawn camping
### Details:
Add respawn function that resets player position to spawn point (x: 400, y: 100). Implement invincibility system: set player.invincible = true for 2 seconds after respawn. During invincibility, ignore all damage and combat interactions. Add visual indicator (blinking sprite) on client-side. Automatically trigger respawn 1 second after death detection. Sync respawn state across all clients via Socket.IO.
<info added on 2025-07-19T00:36:22.115Z>
**COMPLETED: Respawn System with Positioning and Invincibility**

**Implementation Summary:**
Already implemented as part of the integrated death system:

- **`respawnPlayer()` function**: Teleports dead players to random spawn platforms using `PlatformUtils.getPlayerStandingY()`
- **Invincibility system**: Sets `player.isInvincible = true` for 2 seconds (INVINCIBILITY_DURATION = 2000ms)
- **Combat protection**: Updated `handleCombat()` to skip invincible players (`!target.isInvincible`)
- **Automatic respawn**: Scheduled 1 second after death detection (RESPAWN_DELAY = 1000ms)
- **State reset**: Full health restoration, velocity reset, grounded state, jump reset
- **Visual indicators**: Client-side blinking effect for invincible players (cyan color + alpha oscillation)
- **Event synchronization**: `playerRespawn` events broadcast to all clients with position and duration

**Client-side Features:**
- **Respawn visual effects**: Cyan circle + sparkle particles at respawn location
- **Invincibility display**: Blinking cyan sprite with alpha modulation 
- **Status indicators**: "INVINCIBLE" text in UI during invincibility period
- **Event handling**: `handlePlayerRespawn()` and `handleInvincibilityEnd()` functions

**Key Mechanics:**
- Random spawn platform selection (prevents predictable spawning)
- Full state restoration (health, velocity, grounded status)
- 2-second invincibility window prevents spawn camping
- Server-authoritative timing with client visual feedback
- Proper cleanup when invincibility expires

The respawn system is fully functional and integrated with the death detection system.

## 3. Develop Match End Logic and Winner Determination [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create elimination system that removes players when lives reach zero and determines match winner when only one player remains
### Details:
Add elimination logic: when player.lives reaches 0, set player.eliminated = true and remove from active game loop. Track remaining active players count. When only one player remains active, trigger match end event. Determine winner as last surviving player. Broadcast match end event with winner ID and final standings. Implement match reset functionality to start new round. Add spectator mode for eliminated players.
<info added on 2025-07-19T00:54:36.554Z>
**COMPLETED: Match End Logic and Winner Determination**

**Implementation Summary:**
Fully implemented as part of the integrated death system:

**Elimination System:**
- **`checkMatchEnd()` function**: Tracks active players by filtering out eliminated ones
- **Elimination logic**: When `player.lives` reaches 0, sets `player.eliminated = true`
- **Active player tracking**: Uses `Object.keys(players).filter(id => !players[id].eliminated)`
- **Winner determination**: Last surviving player (or null for draw scenarios)

**Match End Events:**
- **`matchEnd` event**: Broadcasts winner ID and complete final standings
- **Final standings**: Array of all players with lives, elimination status, and winner flag
- **Automatic reset**: 5-second delay before starting new round
- **Player state**: Eliminated players remain as spectators until reset

**Match Reset System:**
- **`resetMatch()` function**: Resets all player stats and respawns everyone
- **State restoration**: Lives = 3, health = 100, all flags cleared
- **Position reset**: Random spawn platform selection for all players
- **Event broadcasting**: `matchReset` event announces new round

**Client-side Integration:**
- **Match end overlay**: Full-screen display with winner announcement (updated for 1200px canvas)
- **Final standings**: Ordered list showing all players and their performance  
- **Winner detection**: Special "YOU WIN!" message for local player victories
- **Automatic cleanup**: Overlay removal on match reset
- **Spectator status**: UI indicates eliminated players are spectating

**Key Features:**
- Proper last-player-standing detection
- Comprehensive final standings with all player data
- Automatic match cycling with reset capability
- Client-server synchronization for match state
- Spectator mode for eliminated players

The match end system provides complete tournament-style gameplay with proper winner determination and match cycling.
