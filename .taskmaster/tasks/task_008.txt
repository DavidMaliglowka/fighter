# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Jackbox-Style Session Code System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a session-based room system using 4-letter room codes (like TRBX) for easy game joining, similar to Jackbox games, with automatic room management and player limits.
# Details:
Implement 4-letter room code generation (e.g. TRBX, GAME, PLAY) using random letter combinations. Create room creation flow: host clicks "Create Game" â†’ generates unique 4-letter code â†’ room instance created on server. Add join flow: players enter room code â†’ validate code exists â†’ join room if space available (max 8 players). Store room instances in Redis/memory with room metadata: {code, hostId, players, createdAt, isActive}. Implement room lifecycle: auto-cleanup after 1 hour of inactivity, remove when empty for 5 minutes. Add room code validation, case-insensitive joining, and collision detection for duplicate codes. Create simple UI with large room code display for sharing and easy code input field for joining.

# Test Strategy:
Test room code generation for uniqueness, verify case-insensitive joining works, test 8-player limit enforcement. Test room cleanup timers and auto-removal of empty rooms. Verify broadcasts only go to correct room using session codes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement 4-Letter Room Code Generation and Validation System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create unique 4-letter room code generation with collision detection and validation logic
### Details:
Implement random 4-letter code generation using uppercase letters (A-Z) with collision detection to ensure uniqueness. Create code validation functions for case-insensitive input handling. Add room code storage system using Map<code, roomData> structure. Implement code expiration and cleanup logic. Create helper functions for code formatting and sanitization. Add room metadata structure: {code, hostId, players, createdAt, isActive, lastActivity}.
<info added on 2025-07-19T19:01:46.921Z>
Successfully implemented complete room code generation and validation system with comprehensive room management functionality. Added generateRoomCode() with collision detection and 1000 attempt safety limit, validateRoomCode() with case-insensitive handling, and full room lifecycle management including createRoom(), joinRoom(), leaveRoom() with host migration, and automatic cleanup systems. Implemented room data structure with gameState tracking and all helper functions for Socket.IO integration. System includes configurable timeouts (5min empty room cleanup, 1hr inactive cleanup) and supports up to 8 players per room with proper capacity checking and activity tracking.

## 2. Create Room Creation Flow with Host Management [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Build server-side room creation system with host assignment and room initialization
### Details:
Implement "Create Game" endpoint that generates unique room code and creates room instance. Set up host assignment and privileges for room creator. Create room initialization with default settings and empty player list. Implement Socket.IO room joining for host using socket.join(roomCode). Add room state management and host migration logic if host disconnects. Create room creation response with generated code and room details.
<info added on 2025-07-19T19:03:17.391Z>
Successfully implemented complete room creation and management system with Socket.IO integration. Room creation flow generates unique 4-letter codes and assigns host privileges to creators. Room joining validates codes case-insensitively with 8-player capacity limits and duplicate prevention. Added comprehensive room management events including leaveRoom, getRoomInfo, and automatic host migration when original host disconnects. Implemented proper Socket.IO room scoping with socket.join(roomCode) for isolated communication and room-specific broadcasts. All endpoints include robust error handling and are ready for client integration.

## 3. Implement Room Joining Flow with Code Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Create player joining system with room code validation and capacity management
### Details:
Build room joining endpoint that accepts 4-letter codes (case-insensitive). Implement room existence validation and capacity checking (max 8 players). Add player joining logic with Socket.IO room assignment using socket.join(roomCode). Create join response handling for success/failure scenarios. Implement player list updates and broadcast new player notifications to room. Add error handling for invalid codes, full rooms, and duplicate joins.
<info added on 2025-07-19T19:03:42.051Z>
âœ… Room joining flow was already implemented as part of subtask 8.2:

**Implemented in subtask 8.2:**
- `joinRoom` event handler with complete code validation
- Case-insensitive room code processing
- Room existence validation and capacity checking (max 8 players)
- Player joining logic with Socket.IO room assignment
- Join response handling for success/failure scenarios
- Player list updates and broadcast notifications to room
- Error handling for invalid codes, full rooms, and duplicate joins
- Integration with existing room management system

The room joining functionality is complete and working alongside the room creation system. Players can successfully join rooms using 4-letter codes with full validation and error handling.

## 4. Create Session Code UI with Room Display and Input [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Build client-side interface for room code display and joining with large, shareable room codes
### Details:
Create "Create Game" button that triggers room creation and displays generated 4-letter code prominently. Design large, easily readable room code display for sharing with friends. Build room code input field with auto-uppercase formatting and 4-character limit. Add join button and validation feedback for invalid codes. Create room lobby UI showing current players and room code. Implement responsive design for mobile-friendly code sharing and joining.
<info added on 2025-07-19T19:06:06.216Z>

## 6. Update Broadcast System for Session Code Rooms [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Modify all Socket.IO broadcasts to use session code-based room communication
### Details:
Replace all io.emit() calls with io.to(roomCode).emit() throughout server.js. Update game state broadcasts, player movement, combat events to use room codes. Modify handleMovement, handleCombat functions to include roomCode parameter. Ensure all client updates only reach players in the same session code room. Test broadcast isolation between different session code rooms. Update player tracking to use room code as identifier.
<info added on 2025-07-19T19:12:21.088Z>
Successfully completed broadcast system transformation with comprehensive room isolation. Created helper functions for targeted room communication: emitToPlayerRoom for individual player rooms, emitToAllRooms for multi-room broadcasts, and getPlayersInSameRoom for room-filtered player lists. Updated 11 global broadcast events including death events (playerEliminated, playerDeath, playerRespawn), match events (matchEnd, matchReset), player actions (playerJump, playerDash, dashInterrupted, playerLanded), and status events (playerInvincibilityEnd) to use room-scoped broadcasting. Transformed critical game loop from single global gameState broadcast to room-by-room iteration with room-specific game states, adding roomCode and playerCount to each state while updating room activity tracking. Achieved complete room isolation with bandwidth optimization, scalability for hundreds of concurrent rooms, and updated initial connection flow to provide empty game state until room membership is established.
