# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Hybrid Authentication System (Guest + Optional Accounts)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a hybrid authentication system supporting both anonymous guest play and optional user accounts, similar to Pok√©mon Showdown, with seamless switching between modes.
# Details:
Implement dual authentication modes: Guest play (default) requires only display name entry, no login needed. Optional account system allows username+password registration for persistent stats. Guest players get temporary UUID with local storage persistence. Registered users get JWT tokens with secure session management. Implement identity protection: prevent guests from using registered usernames. Add "Play as Guest" and "Login/Register" options on room join. Support Firebase Auth for user authentication with anonymous and email/password providers. Create user object structure: {userId, username, isGuest, sessionToken, roomCode, displayName}. Add seamless account claiming: guests can register mid-session to save progress. Implement username validation and reservation system.

# Test Strategy:
Test guest play flow with display name only, verify registered user authentication, test identity protection prevents username conflicts. Test seamless account claiming mid-session, verify Firebase Auth integration works properly. Test session persistence for both guest and registered users.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Firebase Auth Setup and Dual Provider Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Firebase Authentication with anonymous and email/password providers for hybrid authentication system
### Details:
Install Firebase SDK and configure Firebase project with Authentication enabled. Set up anonymous authentication provider for guest users. Configure email/password authentication for registered accounts. Create Firebase config and initialization in client. Implement Firebase Auth state listeners to handle authentication changes. Set up proper security rules for anonymous vs authenticated users.

## 2. Guest Authentication Flow with Display Name Entry [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement guest play mode requiring only display name entry with UUID generation and local storage persistence
### Details:
Create guest authentication flow with display name input only (no password required). Generate temporary UUID for guest users using crypto.randomUUID(). Implement local storage persistence for guest sessions with display name and UUID. Add display name validation (3-20 chars, no special characters). Create guest user object with isGuest flag. Implement automatic guest login on return visits using stored UUID.

## 3. Registered User Authentication with JWT Tokens [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement traditional username/password registration and login with JWT token management for persistent accounts
### Details:
Create registration/login UI forms for username and password. Implement Firebase email/password authentication for registered users. Generate JWT tokens for authenticated users with user payload (userId, username, isGuest: false). Add token validation middleware for registered user sessions. Implement secure session management with token refresh. Create persistent user data storage for registered accounts.

## 4. Identity Protection and Username Reservation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Implement system to prevent guests from using registered usernames and manage username reservations
### Details:
Create username reservation database/storage for registered accounts. Implement real-time username validation that checks against reserved names. Add display name conflict detection for guest users attempting to use registered usernames. Create username availability checker with instant feedback. Implement case-insensitive username comparison. Add suggested alternative names when conflicts occur.

## 5. Hybrid User Object Structure and Session Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Implement unified user object structure supporting both guest and registered users with proper session handling
### Details:
Create user object structure: {userId, username, isGuest, sessionToken, roomCode, displayName, createdAt, lastActive}. Implement session management for both guest (UUID-based) and registered (JWT-based) users. Add user lookup functions supporting both authentication types. Implement session cleanup and expiration handling. Create user state synchronization across socket connections.

## 6. Room Join UI with Authentication Mode Selection [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Create room join interface with options for guest play or registered user login/registration
### Details:
Design room join UI with two clear paths: "Play as Guest" and "Login/Register". Create smooth transitions between authentication modes. Add room code input field that works for both user types. Implement authentication mode persistence (remember user preference). Create loading states for both authentication flows. Add clear visual distinction between guest and registered user sessions.

## 7. Seamless Account Claiming and Mid-Session Registration [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.6
### Description: Implement ability for guests to register mid-session to claim their progress and convert to registered accounts
### Details:
Add "Claim Account" option for active guest users during gameplay. Implement mid-session registration flow that preserves current game state and progress. Create account claiming UI that appears as overlay without disrupting gameplay. Transfer guest progress and stats to new registered account. Implement seamless transition from guest to registered user without disconnection. Add confirmation flow for successful account claiming.
