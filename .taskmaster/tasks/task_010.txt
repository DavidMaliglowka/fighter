# Task ID: 10
# Title: Setup MongoDB Database for Player Progression
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate MongoDB database to store player stats, progression, and match history
# Details:
Install mongoose npm package, setup MongoDB Atlas free tier connection. Create user schema: {userId, username, level, xp, wins, losses, gamesPlayed, createdAt}. Create match schema: {matchId, roomId, players, winner, duration, endedAt}. Implement database operations: saveUser(), updateStats(), getPlayerStats(). Add connection handling with retry logic and error handling. Create indexes on userId and username for performance. Implement data validation and sanitization.

# Test Strategy:
Test database connection, user creation/updates work correctly, match data saves properly. Verify data persistence across server restarts and handle connection failures gracefully.

# Subtasks:
## 1. MongoDB Connection and Schema Design [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up MongoDB Atlas connection and design database schemas for user and match data
### Details:
Install mongoose npm package and configure MongoDB Atlas free tier connection. Create user schema with fields: userId, username, level, xp, wins, losses, gamesPlayed, createdAt. Create match schema with fields: matchId, roomId, players, winner, duration, endedAt. Set up proper data types, required fields, and default values for both schemas.

## 2. Database Operations and CRUD Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement core database operations for user and match data management
### Details:
Create database operation functions: saveUser() for new user creation, updateStats() for player progression updates, getPlayerStats() for retrieving user data. Implement match data operations: saveMatch() for storing completed games, getMatchHistory() for retrieving player's past matches. Add proper error handling and data sanitization for all CRUD operations.

## 3. Connection Handling, Error Management, and Retry Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement robust database connection management with error handling and retry mechanisms
### Details:
Set up connection retry logic with exponential backoff for MongoDB connection failures. Implement graceful error handling for database operations with proper logging. Add connection pooling configuration and timeout settings. Create health check functionality to monitor database connectivity and automatic reconnection on connection loss.

## 4. Data Validation, Indexing, and Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Implement data validation, create database indexes, and optimize performance
### Details:
Add comprehensive data validation for user input and match data before database operations. Create indexes on userId and username fields for improved query performance. Implement query optimization techniques and add database performance monitoring. Set up data sanitization to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
