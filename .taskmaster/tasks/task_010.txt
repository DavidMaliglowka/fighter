# Task ID: 10
# Title: Setup Hybrid Firebase + VPS Architecture for User Data and Sessions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement hybrid hosting architecture using Firebase for user authentication and persistent data storage, combined with VPS-hosted game server for real-time multiplayer performance.
# Details:
Set up Firebase Firestore for user profiles, match history, and progression data. Use Firebase for authentication backend while VPS handles real-time game logic. Implement Firestore collections: users (profiles, stats, settings), matches (game results, player performance), rooms (session metadata, timestamps). Create VPS-to-Firebase data sync for match results and user statistics. Use Firebase for persistent data and VPS for real-time gameplay with Socket.IO. Implement offline-first data handling with Firestore offline persistence. Add Firebase Cloud Functions for data processing and aggregation. Create data migration utilities and backup systems. Optimize for Coolify deployment on VPS with Firebase SDK integration. Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms when Firebase is unavailable.

# Test Strategy:
Test Firebase Firestore connection and data operations, verify VPS-to-Firebase sync works correctly, test offline persistence and data recovery. Verify Firebase Cloud Functions execute properly and handle data aggregation. Test fallback mechanisms when Firebase is unavailable and ensure graceful degradation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Firebase Setup and Firestore Collections Design [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Firebase project and design Firestore collections for user data, matches, and rooms
### Details:
Initialize Firebase project and configure Firestore database. Create collections structure: users (userId, username, level, xp, wins, losses, gamesPlayed, settings, createdAt), matches (matchId, roomId, players, winner, duration, endedAt, playerStats), rooms (roomId, sessionData, timestamps, metadata). Set up Firestore security rules and configure offline persistence. Install Firebase SDK and configure for VPS deployment with Coolify.

## 2. VPS-to-Firebase Data Sync Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement real-time data synchronization between VPS game server and Firebase Firestore
### Details:
Create Firebase service layer for VPS server to sync game data. Implement functions: syncUserStats() for player progression updates, saveMatchResult() for completed games, updateRoomMetadata() for session tracking. Set up batched writes for performance optimization and implement retry logic for failed syncs. Create data validation layer before Firebase writes and handle concurrent updates with transactions.

## 3. Firebase Cloud Functions and Data Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement Firebase Cloud Functions for automated data processing and aggregation
### Details:
Create Cloud Functions for: user statistics aggregation (calculating rankings, win rates), match data processing (performance analytics, historical trends), automated cleanup of old session data. Implement triggers for real-time data updates and scheduled functions for periodic maintenance. Add error handling and monitoring for Cloud Functions execution.

## 4. Offline Persistence and Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Implement offline-first data handling with robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
### Details:
Configure Firestore offline persistence for client-side data caching. Implement fallback mechanisms when Firebase is unavailable: local data storage, queue pending operations, graceful degradation of features. Add comprehensive error handling for network failures, Firebase quota limits, and authentication issues. Create health monitoring for Firebase connectivity and automatic retry logic with exponential backoff.

## 5. Data Migration and Backup Systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Create utilities for data migration, backup, and recovery operations
### Details:
Implement data migration utilities for moving existing data to Firebase Firestore. Create automated backup systems using Firebase Admin SDK to export data regularly. Develop data recovery procedures and validation tools to ensure data integrity. Add monitoring and alerting for backup operations and implement disaster recovery protocols.
