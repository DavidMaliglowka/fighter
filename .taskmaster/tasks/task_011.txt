# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Player Progression and Leveling System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Add XP gain, leveling up, and progression tracking based on match performance
# Details:
Define XP rewards: win (+100 XP), participation (+25 XP), combo bonus (+5 XP per combo). Implement leveling formula: level = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(xp / 100)). Add progression events: emit levelUp event to client, unlock rewards at certain levels. Create progression UI: XP bar, level display, stats overview. Track additional stats: damage dealt, combos performed, survival time. Add achievements system: first win, combo master, survivor. Update database after each match with new stats.

# Test Strategy:
Verify XP calculation is correct, level ups trigger properly, stats track accurately. Test progression UI updates in real-time and persists between sessions.
