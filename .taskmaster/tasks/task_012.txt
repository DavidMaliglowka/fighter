# Task ID: 12
# Title: Add Redis for Session Management and Caching
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Integrate Redis for improved session handling, caching, and multi-server scalability preparation
# Details:
Install redis and socket.io-redis npm packages. Setup Redis connection with connection pooling and error handling. Implement session caching: store user sessions in Redis with TTL (24h). Add Socket.IO Redis adapter for multi-server support: io.adapter(redisAdapter({host: 'localhost', port: 6379})). Cache frequently accessed data: player stats, room information. Implement pub/sub for cross-room notifications. Add Redis health checks and fallback to memory storage if Redis unavailable.

# Test Strategy:
Test session persistence in Redis, verify Socket.IO adapter works correctly, cache hit/miss rates are reasonable. Test failover behavior when Redis is unavailable.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Redis Connection Setup and Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install Redis packages and establish secure connection with proper configuration, connection pooling, and error handling
### Details:
Install redis and socket.io-redis npm packages. Configure Redis connection with host, port, password, and database selection. Implement connection pooling with retry logic, timeout settings, and reconnection strategies. Add environment-based configuration for development/production Redis instances. Set up proper error handling for connection failures and network issues.

## 2. Session Caching Implementation with TTL Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Implement Redis-based session storage with automatic expiration and session lifecycle management
### Details:
Create session storage functions to store user sessions in Redis with 24-hour TTL. Implement session retrieval, update, and deletion operations. Add session validation and refresh mechanisms. Handle session expiration gracefully with automatic cleanup. Implement session data serialization/deserialization for complex objects. Add session migration from memory to Redis storage.

## 3. Socket.IO Redis Adapter for Multi-Server Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Configure Socket.IO Redis adapter to enable horizontal scaling and cross-server communication
### Details:
Implement Socket.IO Redis adapter configuration with io.adapter(redisAdapter({host: 'localhost', port: 6379})). Set up pub/sub channels for cross-server room management and event broadcasting. Configure adapter for sticky sessions and load balancing compatibility. Implement cross-server room synchronization and player state management. Add adapter health monitoring and failover logic.

## 4. Data Caching Strategy for Frequently Accessed Information [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Implement intelligent caching system for player stats, room information, and game data with cache invalidation
### Details:
Design caching strategy for player stats, room information, and leaderboards with appropriate TTL values. Implement cache-aside pattern with automatic cache warming and invalidation. Add cache hit/miss tracking and performance monitoring. Create cached data structures for frequently accessed game state. Implement cache eviction policies and memory management. Add cache synchronization for real-time data updates.

## 5. Health Checks and Fallback Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3, 12.4
### Description: Implement Redis health monitoring, graceful degradation, and fallback to memory storage when Redis is unavailable
### Details:
Create Redis health check endpoints and monitoring functions. Implement graceful fallback to in-memory storage when Redis is unavailable. Add automatic Redis reconnection with exponential backoff. Create health status reporting and alerting mechanisms. Implement data synchronization when Redis comes back online. Add performance metrics tracking for Redis operations and fallback scenarios.
