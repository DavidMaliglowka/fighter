# Task ID: 13
# Title: Optimize Game Loop Performance and Broadcasting
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Profile and optimize the 60fps game loop, implement delta updates and performance monitoring
# Details:
Add performance profiling using console.time() around game loop sections. Implement delta updates: only broadcast changed player data instead of full state. Add performance metrics: track loop execution time, broadcast frequency, memory usage. Optimize collision detection: use spatial partitioning for large player counts. Implement adaptive tick rate: reduce to 30fps if server load is high. Add performance monitoring dashboard showing real-time metrics. Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects.

# Test Strategy:
Measure game loop performance before/after optimizations, verify delta updates reduce bandwidth, monitor memory usage over time. Test with maximum 8 players per room under load.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Performance Profiling and Metrics Collection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive performance profiling system to measure game loop execution time, memory usage, and identify bottlenecks
### Details:
Add console.time() and console.timeEnd() around critical game loop sections. Implement performance metrics tracking for loop execution time, broadcast frequency, memory usage, and CPU utilization. Create performance data collection system that samples metrics every second and stores historical data. Add memory leak detection by monitoring object creation/destruction patterns. Implement frame time analysis to identify performance spikes and their causes.

## 2. Delta Update Implementation for Reduced Bandwidth [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Implement delta updates to broadcast only changed player data instead of full game state, reducing network bandwidth usage
### Details:
Create state comparison system to detect changes in player positions, health, and status. Implement delta compression algorithm that only sends modified properties. Add state versioning to track changes between updates. Create efficient data structures for storing previous states and calculating deltas. Implement fallback to full state updates when delta size exceeds threshold or after connection issues.

## 3. Collision Detection Optimization and Spatial Partitioning [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Optimize collision detection using spatial partitioning techniques to handle large player counts efficiently
### Details:
Implement spatial partitioning using quadtree or grid-based system to reduce collision checks from O(nÂ²) to O(n log n). Create spatial hash map for fast neighbor queries. Optimize broad-phase collision detection by only checking nearby objects. Implement efficient bounding box calculations and early rejection tests. Add dynamic spatial subdivision based on player density in different areas of the game world.

## 4. Adaptive Tick Rate and Load Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2, 13.3
### Description: Implement adaptive tick rate system that adjusts game loop frequency based on server load and performance metrics
### Details:
Create load monitoring system that tracks CPU usage, memory consumption, and network bandwidth. Implement adaptive tick rate algorithm that reduces from 60fps to 30fps when server load exceeds thresholds. Add priority-based update system where critical updates (player movement) maintain higher frequency than non-critical updates (UI elements). Implement load balancing strategies and graceful degradation when approaching capacity limits.

## 5. Object Pooling and Memory Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Implement object pooling system and memory optimization techniques to reduce garbage collection and improve performance
### Details:
Create object pools for frequently created/destroyed objects like bullets, particles, and temporary game entities. Implement memory-efficient data structures and reduce object allocations in hot code paths. Add garbage collection monitoring and optimization strategies. Implement efficient string handling and reduce string concatenation in performance-critical sections. Create memory usage profiling tools to identify memory leaks and optimization opportunities.

## 6. Performance Monitoring Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.4, 13.5
### Description: Create real-time performance monitoring dashboard displaying key metrics, alerts, and system health indicators
### Details:
Build web-based dashboard showing real-time performance metrics including FPS, memory usage, network bandwidth, and player counts. Implement alert system for performance threshold violations. Create historical performance graphs and trend analysis. Add system health indicators with color-coded status displays. Implement performance comparison tools to measure optimization effectiveness and regression detection.
