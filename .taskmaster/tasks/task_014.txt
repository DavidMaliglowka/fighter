# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Client-Side Prediction and Lag Compensation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Add client-side prediction for smooth gameplay and server reconciliation for authoritative state
# Details:
Implement client-side prediction: predict movement, jumping, and attacks locally before server confirmation. Add input buffering: queue inputs during network delays. Implement server reconciliation: compare predicted vs actual positions, smoothly interpolate corrections. Add lag compensation: timestamp inputs, replay game state for hit detection. Use Phaser's interpolation for smooth position updates. Add network quality indicators: ping display, packet loss detection. Implement rollback for critical state mismatches.

# Test Strategy:
Test gameplay feels smooth with simulated network delays, verify server corrections don't cause jarring movement, hit detection works accurately with lag compensation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Client-Side Movement and Action Prediction [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create client-side prediction system for immediate response to player inputs including movement, jumping, and combat actions
### Details:
Implement local prediction for movement (WASD/arrow keys), jumping (spacebar), and attack actions (mouse clicks) in client-side game loop. Create predictive state management that applies inputs immediately without waiting for server confirmation. Store predicted positions and states in client memory. Implement prediction for physics-based movement including gravity, velocity, and collision detection. Add prediction validation to ensure client predictions don't exceed game rules (jump limits, movement bounds). Use Phaser's physics system for local calculations matching server-side physics.
