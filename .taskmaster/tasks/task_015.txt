# Task ID: 15
# Title: Add Comprehensive Testing and Error Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement robust error handling, logging, and automated testing for multiplayer scenarios
# Details:
Add comprehensive error handling: try-catch blocks around critical sections, graceful degradation for network issues. Implement structured logging using winston: separate log levels for development/production. Add automated testing: unit tests for game logic, integration tests for Socket.IO events. Create multiplayer test scenarios: simulate disconnections, network delays, concurrent actions. Add monitoring: track error rates, performance metrics, user engagement. Implement graceful shutdown procedures and cleanup routines. Add client-side error reporting and recovery mechanisms.

# Test Strategy:
Run automated test suite covering all game mechanics, simulate various failure scenarios, verify error handling doesn't crash server. Test recovery from network issues and server restarts.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and Graceful Degradation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add try-catch blocks around critical sections, implement graceful degradation for network issues, and create fallback mechanisms for various failure scenarios
### Details:
Wrap all Socket.IO event handlers in try-catch blocks, implement error boundaries for game logic functions, add graceful degradation for network disconnections, create fallback UI states for offline mode, implement retry mechanisms for failed operations, add error recovery procedures for corrupted game state

## 2. Set Up Structured Logging System with Winston [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure winston logger with different log levels, file rotation, and structured logging for development and production environments
### Details:
Install and configure winston with multiple transports (console, file, error file), set up log levels (error, warn, info, debug), implement log rotation and archiving, create structured log format with timestamps and metadata, add request/response logging middleware, configure different logging strategies for development vs production

## 3. Create Automated Testing Suite for Game Logic and Multiplayer [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests covering game mechanics, Socket.IO events, and multiplayer scenarios
### Details:
Set up Jest testing framework, create unit tests for game logic functions (movement, combat, collision), implement integration tests for Socket.IO events, create multiplayer test scenarios simulating disconnections and network delays, add test coverage for concurrent player actions, implement mock Socket.IO clients for testing, create automated test runners for CI/CD

## 4. Implement Monitoring and Metrics Collection [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Set up monitoring system to track error rates, performance metrics, user engagement, and system health indicators
### Details:
Implement metrics collection for error rates, response times, and user actions, set up performance monitoring for server resources (CPU, memory, network), create dashboards for real-time monitoring, add alerting for critical errors and performance degradation, implement user engagement tracking (session duration, actions per minute), set up health check endpoints for load balancers

## 5. Implement Graceful Shutdown and Cleanup Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.4
### Description: Create proper shutdown procedures to handle server restarts, clean up resources, and maintain data integrity during shutdown
### Details:
Implement SIGTERM and SIGINT signal handlers, create graceful shutdown sequence for Socket.IO connections, add cleanup procedures for active games and player sessions, implement database connection cleanup, create backup procedures for in-memory game state, add timeout mechanisms for shutdown process, implement restart recovery procedures to restore game state
