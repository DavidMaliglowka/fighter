# Task ID: 16
# Title: Integrate Sprites and Art Assets to Replace Basic Rectangles
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Replace current basic colored rectangles with proper fighter sprites, animations, and visual assets including character sprites, attack animations, visual effects, backgrounds, and UI elements.
# Details:
Create comprehensive art asset integration system: Set up asset loading pipeline in Phaser 3 using scene.load.spritesheet() for character animations and scene.load.image() for static assets. Replace basic rectangle rendering with sprite-based rendering for all game entities. Implement character sprite sheets with idle, walking, jumping, and falling animations using Phaser's animation system (scene.anims.create()). Create attack animation sequences for all three attack types (light, heavy, ranged) with proper timing and visual feedback. Add visual effects for combat: hit sparks, damage numbers, screen shake on heavy attacks. Design and implement background art layers with parallax scrolling for depth. Replace platform rectangles with themed platform sprites (stone, metal, wood variants). Create UI sprite assets for health bars, lives counter, ability cooldowns, and room codes display. Implement particle effects for item pickups, respawn sequences, and special abilities. Add character class visual differentiation through sprite variants and color schemes. Ensure all sprites are properly scaled and positioned to match existing collision boundaries. Implement sprite animation state management synchronized with game logic states.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all basic rectangles are replaced with appropriate sprites across all game states. Test character animations play correctly during movement, jumping, and combat actions. Confirm attack animations sync properly with damage dealing and cooldown timers. Test visual effects display correctly for all players simultaneously in multiplayer scenarios. Verify background and platform sprites render without performance issues. Test UI elements display correctly at different screen resolutions. Confirm sprite collision boundaries match existing gameplay mechanics. Test asset loading doesn't cause significant startup delays or memory issues.
